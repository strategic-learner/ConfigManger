for remodeling the J_% tables:
For some reason migrations put the dropTable statements after the CreateTable statements
then threw error "There is already an object named 'J_Config_Executable' in the database."
  -No Duh

tried rescaffolding, same sequence

manually moved the drop table between dropindex & createtable statements... worked fine
